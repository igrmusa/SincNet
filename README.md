# SincNet

This project is part of my Master Studies Scientific Computation course. The code is writen using Python. <br>
The project is done in collaboration with Milos Nikolic. <br><br><br> The main idea of this project is to present SincNet which is a neural network for efficiently processing raw audio samples. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which implement band-pass filters. It is used on TIMIT database for speaker identification.

**Dataset** <br>
SincNet is trained and evaluated on DARPA Timit dataset. This dataset is designed to provide speach data for acoustic-phonetic studies and for the development and evaluation of automatic speach recognition systems. TIMIT contains broadband recordings of 630 speakers of eight major dialects of American English, each reading ten phonetically rich sentences. This dataset also includes time-aligned orthographic, phonetic and word transcriptios as well as a 16-bit, 16kHz speach waveform file for each utterance.  This dataset can be found on the following link **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfekadu/darpa-timit-acousticphonetic-continuous-speech**
