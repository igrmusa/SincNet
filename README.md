# SincNet

This project is part of my Master Studies Scientific Computation course. The code is writen using Python. <br>
The project is done in collaboration with Milos Nikolic. <br> The main idea of this project is to present SincNet which is a neural network for efficiently processing raw audio samples. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which implement band-pass filters. It is used on TIMIT database for speaker identification.
