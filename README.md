# SincNet

This project is part of my Master Studies Scientific Computation course. The code is writen using Python. The project is done in collaboration with Milos Nikolic. The main idea of this project is to present SincNet which is a neural network for efficiently processing raw audio samples. SincNet is based on parametrized sinc functions, which implement band-pass filters.
